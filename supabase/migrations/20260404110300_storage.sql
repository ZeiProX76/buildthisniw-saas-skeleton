-- Migration Group 4: Storage buckets
-- Creates the avatars bucket and RLS policies for file operations.
-- The bucket is PUBLIC — downloads bypass RLS (anyone with URL can view).
-- RLS is only needed for writes (upload, update, delete) scoped to the user's own folder.
-- 20 MB limit is generous — client-side compression (browser-image-compression)
-- converts to WebP ~500KB before upload. The limit is a safety net.

-- 4a: avatars bucket (public, 5 MB limit, images only)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'avatars',
  'avatars',
  true,

  array['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp']
);

-- SELECT: public bucket bypasses this for downloads, but belt-and-suspenders

  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
